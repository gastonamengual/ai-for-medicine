# AI for Medicine

This repository shows different AI solutions for medicine problems, including the application of traditional Machine Learning algorithms, as well as Deep Learning techniques with Neural Networks.

For the moment, I have not created this notebooks from scratch. They are notebooks I prepared from other existing projects, such as Medicine for AI Specialization (Coursera) and Machine Learning for Healthcare Analytics Projects (Eduonix Learning Solutions). Although they are in essence the same notebooks given by the authors, I made some changes regarding the code, the text and the explanations, and added a wider theoretical framework of the subjects studied.
